  "summary": "REQ-28 is largely implemented via new export scripts that generate a deterministic ZIP (frontend/export/project-source.zip) while excluding common dependency/build folders and printing the output path. However, the diff does not clearly show a single documented repo-root command (e.g., npm script or root-level wrapper), and the scripts include emoji symbols in console output which may violate the English-only user-facing text constraint.",

      "requirement": "A single command is documented and available (e.g., via an npm script or shell script) that produces a .zip file from the repository root.",
      "reason": "While export scripts and a doc were added under frontend/, the diff does not show a repository-root level command (e.g., package.json script or root-level script) nor clearly shows the documented one-command invocation from the repo root due to the documentation being truncated and located in frontend/.",
